  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>

<p> Greetings! Born in Mountain View, but lived most of my life in Sunnyvale. I am Evan Eron Villaflor and I am a second generation Filipino American. Growing and being engulfed into many social medias and living in the SIlicon Valley environment, helped into becoming a Digital Media Artist. Throughout elementary and high school I wanted to become an Engineer for my family, although the heavy workload that comes with it became too overwhelming for me. Along with coming on and off in relationships with different significant others, I began to drop classes, created a habit of late attendance, and soon forgot to turn in major assignments. </p>
  
<p> I took a sculpture class at De Anza College and it re-sparked my inspiration of becoming an Artist. The power it gave me from the process making of your idea, and the satisfaction you have after creating the piece was that little something I was missing in my calculus and science classes. To the artist the final piece could always be worked on, so an exceptional grade is unexpected. The other ideas that flow within a critique can be interpreted differently and seeing/hearing others opinions from what you made brings the excitement, anxiety, and joy of creating other pieces. Art never was just one answer for me. You can branch out into different directions, create representational or non-representational pieces and still have a meaning within them. Craft comes along with practice and the more you do your medium the better you get at it. The idea of constructive learning was installed into my head. The thought of “I don’t get it now” is erased and replaced with “I don’t get it yet” and eventually will. </p>
  
<p> Within my artwork I try to describe the struggles that life holds, determination, hard work, and other inspirations that can help hold one's head up. Struggles that could include feelings of depression, loneliness, separation, poverty and then range through a spectrum of emotions that express a person’s happiness, joy, and laughter. Lately, I have been exploring themes of emotion and the different hardships that one may come across or experience within their lifetime. Most of my work will include shapes of circles, spirals and twirls to represent cycles, repetition, symmetry, ideas of karma, yin and yang balance, and subjects that people usually don't talk about through digital media and video. 
Influenced by multiple artwork from Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Frida Kahlo, Audrey Flack, Barry Mcgee, designs from different cartoons, video games, manga, animations, animals and other culture/identities. You'll either find seriousness or warming filled joy in my artwork as I try to hopefully relate to as many people as possible through relatable connections, emotions and the experiences I have had in California. </p>
