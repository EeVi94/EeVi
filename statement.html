  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>

<p> Welcome! Born in Mountain View, but raised in Sunnyvale. My names, Evan Eron Villaflor, I am a second generation Filipino American who grew up in the perfect place and time. With intial experiece coming from multiple social medias platforms (MySpace,Facebook,Xanga) and living in the Silicon Valley, Santa Clara County speficially, has helped push me into becoming a Digital Media Artist. Wanted to become an Engineer as a kid changed through the heavy workload that came with it. During my time at De Anza Community College, the math portion became too overwhelming for me . Along with coming on and off in relationships with different significant others, I began to drop classes, created a habit of late attendance, and soon forgot to turn in major assignments. </p>
  
<p> I took a sculpture class at De Anza College and it re-sparked my inspiration of becoming an Artist. The power it gave me from the process making, of your idea, and the satisfaction you have after creating the piece was that "little something" that I was missing in my calculus and science classes. To the artist the final piece could always be worked on, so an exceptional grade is unexpected. The other ideas that flow within a critique can be interpreted differently and seeing/hearing others opinions from what you made brings the excitement, anxiety, and joy of creating other pieces. Art never was just one answer for me. You can branch out into different directions, create representational or non-representational pieces and still have a meaning within them. Craft comes along with practice and the more you do your medium the better you get at it. The idea of constructive learning was installed into my head. The thought of “I don’t get it now” is erased and replaced with “I don’t get it yet” and eventually will. </p>
  
<p> Taking this path further I then applied to San Jose State 
University. <br> 
Through the DMA program I was able to express feelings in art I never got to with Acylic and Graphite. Within my artwork I try to describe the struggles that life holds, determination, hard work, and other inspirations that can help hold one's head up. Struggles that could include feelings of depression, loneliness, separation, poverty and then range through a spectrum of emotions that express a person’s happiness, joy, and laughter. Lately, I have been exploring themes of emotion and the different hardships that one may come across or experience within their lifetime (Weight Gain/Loss, Communication with Specific Others, Overload in work, etc). Most of my work will include shapes of circles, spirals and twirls to represent cycles, repetition, symmetry, ideas of karma, yin and yang balance, and subjects that people usually don't talk about through Digital media Art and Video. 
Influenced by multiple artwork from Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Frida Kahlo, Audrey Flack, Barry Mcgee, designs from different cartoons, comics, video games, manga, animations, animals and other culture/identities. You'll either find seriousness or warming filled joy in my artwork as I try to hopefully relate to as many people as possible through relatable connections, emotions and the experiences I have had living in California. </p>
