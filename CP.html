<center><P style="background-color:black;"> <font size="5"> <font color="white">The light outside is the closest I can get to socializing with someone else besides my family and some to none of my friends. This "Stay-at-Home '' is being extended unttil the end of May 2020 and who knows how long this will go on. This situation has got me stuck to all of my Electronic devices; CellPhones, Computer/Laptop, Gaming Consoles, Television, etc. 
Being to a point where I have almost become a Zombie, has got me locked up on my phone and Computer longer than usual, sweatier than usual. Same Spot, Same Place Every Day. This was rather stressful and not the ideal Online Classes that I expected which is why I never signed up for them. My free time was on the Computer, and now my whole time is on the Computer. This whole situation has got me "Bored" and being the jobless workaholic I am, I started researching a lot about the COVID-19 pandemic, how to stay healthy, and how to find a purpose during this Quarantine. Staying Tuned, reading articles online, taking breaks sometimes, I figured out that I was not bored, I was getting "informed". I was motivating myself to figure out what was going on here, I did not succumb to the numbness. Then the Stimulus checks came in and I questioned and asked after coming back from a grocery run, "Is this even enough?". I must sign up for Unemployment! Why haven't I applied for Unemployment? (SERVER was BUSY at the moment).
<br>
I never took Interacting or School for granted, and I always wanted it to end during the semesters, but it was that it was part of my daily routine, my condition responses, which made me miss it even more. Although, the online version of Evan (ME) was not entirely focused into Zoom University, I'm glad that it gave me a heartbeat, a chance or sign that this "Flu" or so our president says will go away. Although, this is not just a "Flu" apparently President Trump is a misinformed idiot and this is  actually a "very deadly VIRUS". I can take a multitude amount of shots of Martini's due to how many people I have seen not wearing a mask, not taking it seriously. This quarantine has got me fit though, working out at home, and eating less fast food is something, but what if it was all planned? 
The stock markets have seen their best years in 50 years through everyone continuously buying produce and essential items in our markets. Factories are said to close soon so meat too may soon become scarce as well. The people are losing their jobs and losing them fast, more than 30 percent of more people are estimated to lose their jobs, and the Great Depression had 24.9%. Although, the internet wasn't booming at the time and got me thinking of those people who can't just afford their rent, but people who are HOMELESS and the people who are still WORKING. These people sacrifice everyday towards exposure the most and it's terrible that they have no place to self-clean and maintain themselves.

"Zlaying deals with the effects of staying inside on your devices to lock, 
<Br>
you forget to unlock and open up to others or unlock and go outside for a bit. 
<br>
Nevertheless, you can easily unlock the passcode on your phone to continue streaming that 
<br>youtube video, tiktok, insta pic, or snapchat.

I began to think of myself as worthless and what was the point of me being here when I have no work or friends to do anything with. 
<br>
This got me thinking about what is my purpose in life and what do I have to do to stay healthy. 
<br>Self-care and mental health is hard to manage in a time when you feel locked in a cage. Sometimes it's good for a break, but how long is this break going to last. 
<br>Everything is resuming soon, but will socializing and interacting with others ever be the same and at what precautions.

After getting back my Stimulus I started to wonder if it is even enough after my first Grocery run. 
<Br>This is not enough to pay my rent, this is not enough to pay for my schooling
 with or without financial aid,
 <br> my transportation/commute, my essential oils, my food for my family and cats! 
<br>
Although we are getting something, I can't believe this is happening to us.

What if this was all a Plan? What if we decide to re-elect Trump simply because "He got us out of this Pandemic". *4 more years *4 more years, Started to ring in my head and made me look at everything in a bigger picture. 
This is happening to us, this is happening fast and now, this is spreading out there and knowledge about it is spreading online. The businesses like Target in a small area like where I live are Walmart, the kids Mall, the Parents Electronic place, is BOOMING. While small businesses like massage parlors, haircut places, and small restaurants are suffering from the effect. Others simply have to "Work from Home '' and not all of us are fortunate to still have a job either. 
If he gets us out of this, I won't vote for him, but he will look good going out and I don't see no other reason why this would have not been planned, or taken less seriously ( Me talking about this COVID-19 situation).

Documentation video of all my Photoshop Images and how they all connect together with the Artist Statement above. "Zlaying"  and locking myself inside, to "Ibored" finding  purpose, and in "StillNotEnoughmulus" pointing that everyone else is in a different situation in terms of housing and money. Lastly, "Tidiots", shows the amount of misinformation that is given to our President Donald Trump and home much he addresses it towards the people. This video integrates some old school favorites in parody form and some short clips of the ONLY things I've been able to see during this Quarantine. - 4/30/20 - Evan V.
